# Wildcard Matching
  Solution to exercise inspired by Problem 44 at LeetCode [ https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/ ]
  
  Define a string pattern that may contain '?', '*' and any other character.
  '?' matches any single character, and '*' matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence). 
  Other characters in a string pattern only match themselves. The empty pattern only matches the empty string.
  
  Provide a function `isMatch' such that `isMatch s p' returns `True' if (and only if) the string pattern p matches the entire string s.
